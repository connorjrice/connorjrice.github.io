This game was the result of an independent study at Colorado College with professor Matthew Whitehead. I learned an incredible amount about good coding practices and new algorithms through the development process. The game features A* pathfinding and custom datastructures, as well as original music/sound design.\r\n![Gameplay](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ShortCircuit.PNG)\r\n> Here is footage of a different level, which shows a secondary texture pack.\r\n![Gameplay](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ShortCircuit2.png)\r\n\r\n## Short Circuit SDK\r\n[Short Circuit SDK profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ScSDK/)\r\n> Along with Short Circuit, I developed an SDK program which reads in an XML level file and creates a serialized object of the level that is more accessible and faster to load by the game engine. Eventually, this project will allow users to create their own levels.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/scsdk1.png)\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/scsdk2.png)\r\n\r\n## Critical Tools\r\n[Critical Tools profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/CriticalTools/)\r\n> Music software suite designed to aid in the production of a Musical Critical Edition. This project was accomplished partly due to a grant from the Mellon Foundation. Originally, this was going to form the basis for my thesis work, but I decided to take a slightly different direction. Below you can see the main features of the software, which allows the user to find a particular measure of music from a library of images that is in processed by the user. It provides a structure for organizing images that represent a score.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ct1.PNG)\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ct2.PNG)\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ct3.PNG)\r\n\r\n## Data Structures\r\n[Data structures profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/DataStructures/)\r\n> Java implementations of various data structures. Pictured below is a data structure that I built especially for Short Circuit.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ds1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Come Together\r\n[Come Together profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ComeTogether/)\r\n\r\n[Come Together second implementation](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ComeTogetherCG/)\r\n> Game I designed in a now defunct engine called \"Slick2D\", and in a custom engine. It's a game about trying to bring two squares together, only to have them torn apart by other, slightly smaller squares.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/ctg1.png)\r\n\r\n## Yahtzee clone\r\n[Yahtzee profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/Yahtzee)\r\n> Game that probably breaks trademark, but I'm never planning on selling it. Written in C++/CLI. I am not a huge fan of CLI. C++ is a language that I would really like to develop more in, but I usually find myself working in Java.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/yaht1.png)\r\n\r\n## Cube rotator\r\n> Fun application I made in Computer Graphics.\r\n![Screenshot](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/cube1.png)\r\n\r\n## jPath\r\n[jPath profile](http://screamconjoiner.github.io/jPath/)\r\n> Example of A* pathfinding. This application was the basis for the pathfinding implementation in Short Circuit. Currently, the project is in a bit of a \"development \r\n\r\n\r\n# Other related work\r\n\r\n## Cigar box gamelan\r\n> Arduino project\r\n\r\n## Musical work\r\n> In addition to computer science, I am currently working towards a major in music. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact me about anything, please email me at\r\nconnor [dot] rice [at] coloradocollege [dot edu]\r\n\r\nAll projects Â© Connor Rice, 2013-2015","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
